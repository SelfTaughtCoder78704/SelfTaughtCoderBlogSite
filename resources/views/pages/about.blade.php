       <p>Do you want to leave poverty behind?
       You Do? Great! That's what the Self-Taught
       Coder is all about. This is where <mark><strong>YOU</strong></mark> can make
       a <mark><strong>SUPER-CHANGE</strong></mark>. Not just a change in your knowledge
       of coding, but also a change in the knowledge of Living!<br>
       Here, we want money falling from the ceiling! Here, we want to ONE DAY work from HOME! 
       And what is wrong with that? Personally, I've done boring, go-nowhere hard labor work 
       (out in the heat and the freezing cold). 
       And truthfully, that shit ain't  for me! Sorry but NOT SORRY.<br>
       And another hard and cold truth...<br>
       This code shit can MAKE YOUR FUCKIN DREAMS COME TRUE! But nobody wants you to know that.
       Sure, you know and they say you can make a lot of money IF you're smart enough. But they 
       LIE! This Code Shit Isn't That Hard To Learn. And you don't have to be a genius. All you need is 
       PERSISTANCE, a computer, and the drive in your heart to break away from that Hard-taught Old Life. </p>
